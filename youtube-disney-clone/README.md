#DISNEY+ CLONE APP

The deployed app is available by clicking the url below:

https://disneyplus-clone-d3e93.web.app/


Technologies used:

- React.js
- Redux
- Firebase/Firestore
- Styled Components


The application is a Disney+ clone, it is designed after the Disney+ website. The application does not play the movies or series that are listed, it goes as far as the information page of the the movies and the series.


The application uses Firebase Authentication, if you want to log in a Google popup will show for authentication. I am not storing any kind of data of anybody who is going to check this application, this is only for exploring and implementing the technology.


All the information regarding the movies and series are stored in a database on Firebase and all the information is being pulled from there.


Hope you will enjoy this demo!
